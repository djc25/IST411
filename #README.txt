Queries.java runs a standalone jpScoreboard panel with populated tables and labels from queries.

I couldn't find a way to update an already initialized jpScoreboard1 panel in jfClient.java.
There didn't seem to be a way I can reference back to jpScoreboard1 panel initialized in jfClient.java let 
alone update it using the ResultSets as shown in Queries.java main class. 

Due to this reason the current jpScoreboard.java panel in unpopulated without any data.
If you can find a way to make the connection work, let me know!
